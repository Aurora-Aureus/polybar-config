# Polybar Config
This is my current polybar config

Make sure you have the fonts Siji, CtrlD, MaterialIcons and WeatherIcons installed!

To use this config put the directory 'config' and all the containing files into a `~/.config/polybar/` directory.
Then add `~/.config/polybar/config/start.sh` into the WM's initialization script.
Now either restart the WM or launch the `start.sh` script manually.
